# **Code Of Conduct**

Our mission at Lingo is to create an open and respectful environment for all of our users and contributors. Your willingness to contribute helps our product grow creatively and impacts users all over the world.



We welcome discussion and we understand this can lead to conflicting viewpoints. It is hard to solve problems from a one sided argument. There will always be a difference in opinion when working on a big collaborative project. However, there will be no tolerance of offense or aggression. We are committed to creating a safe, productive, and harassment-free environment for everyone. We want to explicitly state our guidelines in an effort to support a healthy community in the event of such challenges and differences. 



By accepting and following these principles, you will help Lingo be a safe community for all. If you have any questions or concerns about the Code of Conduct, please feel free to contact our Code of Contact Committee at conductcommittee@lingo.org.

1. **Be patient and considerate to others**. We are all working together on this project. Some may take longer than others to understand ideas or how they want to formulate their idea. Help others if you see they are struggling, but above all, be patient and think about how your actions could be interpreted by others.
2. **Be welcoming**. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, physical appearance, family status, technological or professional choices, academic discipline, religion, mental ability, and physical ability.
3. **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. Itâ€™s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
4. **Be careful with your choice of words**. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other community members. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
   - Violent threats or violent language directed against another person
   - Discriminatory jokes and language
   - Posting sexually explicit or violent material
   - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing")
   - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms
   - Unwelcome sexual attention
   - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
   - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop



Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

#### **Reporting**

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report this in a timely manner. Code of conduct violations reduce the value of the community for everyone and we take them seriously.
